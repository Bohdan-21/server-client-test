This is a minimal client-server application written in C as a personal learning exercise.

Components
Server

    Listens for incoming client connections on a local socket.

    Initializes a session for each client and tracks its dialog state.

    Uses non-blocking I/O and pselect for multiplexing.

    Handles shutdown:

        SIGUSR1 — Reloads dialog configuration from file.

        SIGINT — Terminates the server, closing all sessions cleanly.

Client

    Connects to the server.

    Alternates between reading messages and sending user input.

    Maintains two buffers:

        Input buffer (receives server messages).

        Output buffer (stores user replies).

Modules
list

    Generic linked list.

    Used for storing both session and dialog objects.

buffer

    Manages in-memory strings as character buffers.

    Provides utilities for reading, writing, and searching data.

dialog

    Represents a single message.

session

    Represents an active connection.

    Stores dialog state, received answers, and socket descriptor.

Limitations

    Maximum length of a single input line is 128 characters (including the null-terminator \0).

    The client and server communicate using standard null-terminated C strings. However, incoming data (e.g., from user input or files) include newline characters, which are handled during parsing.
